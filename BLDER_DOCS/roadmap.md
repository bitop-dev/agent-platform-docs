# Build Roadmap

A phased plan that delivers real value at each milestone, building toward the full vision.

Each phase is labeled with the repo(s) it primarily lives in. See [repository-structure.md](../repository-structure.md) for repo boundaries.

---

## Phase 0 — Agent Core (`agent-core`) (Week 1–2)
**Goal**: A standalone agent binary that can run a mission from a YAML config and stream output to the terminal. No database, no web UI, no API — just the core runtime working end-to-end.

### Deliverables
- [x] `agent-core` repo: Go module, directory structure, Makefile
- [x] `AgentConfig` YAML schema + loader + validator
- [x] `Provider` interface + Anthropic streaming implementation
- [x] Basic turn loop (text only — no tool calling yet)
- [x] `RunEvent` channel-based event stream
- [x] Text output renderer (streaming to stdout, with color)
- [x] `agent-core run --config myagent.yaml --mission "..."` works end-to-end
- [x] `agent-core validate` command
- [x] Example agent YAML configs in `examples/`

### Success Criteria ✅
`agent-core run --config examples/basic.yaml --mission "Explain what a goroutine is"` streams a response to the terminal from Claude.

---

## Phase 1 — Agent Core: Tools + Skills (`agent-core`) (Week 3–4) ✅
**Goal**: Agents can call tools and load skills. The binary is fully useful for real tasks.

### Deliverables
- [x] `Tool` interface + `ToolEngine` with parallel execution
- [x] Built-in tools: `bash` (opt-out), `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_dir`, `grep`, `http_fetch`, `tasks`
- [x] Subprocess tool runner (external tools via stdin/stdout JSON)
- [x] Tool sandboxing: path scope, env allowlist, output truncation, timeout
- [x] Tool calling in the turn loop (native tool calling)
- [x] Skill loader: reads `SKILL.md`, injects into system prompt
- [x] 7 bundled skill reference implementations in planning docs
- [x] Loop detection (no-progress, ping-pong, failure streak)
- [x] Deferred-action detection + retry prompt
- [x] Credential scrubbing from tool output
- [x] Approval manager (CLI prompts for dangerous tools, --approve flag)
- [x] Safety heartbeat (re-inject constraints every N turns)
- [x] `agent-core chat` interactive mode + session persistence
- [x] JSON + JSONL output formats (`--format json|jsonl`)
- [x] OpenAI + Anthropic + OpenAI Responses + Ollama providers
- [x] `pkg/agent` public API exported for `platform-api` to import
- [x] MCP support (stdio + HTTP transports)
- [x] Cost tracking (token usage + USD estimation)
- [x] Context compaction (proactive + reactive)
- [x] ReliableProvider (retry, backoff, key rotation, model fallback)

### Success Criteria ✅
Tested with real MCP servers (context7, tanstack), real LLM APIs, multi-tool agent runs.
111 tests passing. 22 commits on main.

---

## Phase 2 — Platform API: Foundation (`platform-api`) (Week 5–7)
**Goal**: REST API that wraps agent-core — agents and runs are persistent, streamable over WebSocket.

### Deliverables
- [ ] `platform-api` repo: Go module, directory structure
- [ ] Database schema + migrations (SQLite dev, PostgreSQL prod)
- [ ] Agent CRUD API (`/api/v1/agents`)
- [ ] Runs API (`/api/v1/runs`) — triggers `agent-core/pkg/agent` in-process
- [ ] WebSocket run streaming (`/api/v1/runs/:id/stream`)
- [ ] Run persistence (run records + events stored in DB)
- [ ] JWT authentication (login/logout/refresh)
- [ ] Skills sync from `skills` repo → local DB registry
- [ ] Skills CRUD API (`/api/v1/skills`)

### Success Criteria
Can create an agent via API call, trigger a run, and stream its events over WebSocket.

---

## Phase 3 — Web Portal: First UI (`platform-web`) (Week 8–9)
**Goal**: A browser you can use to create agents and watch runs live.

### Deliverables
- [ ] `platform-web` repo: Next.js App Router setup
- [ ] Agent list + create + detail pages
- [ ] Run Monitor: live streaming view (WebSocket → token-by-token display)

### Success Criteria
Can log in, create an agent through the browser, trigger a run, and watch it stream in real time.

---

## Phase 4 — Skills Repo + Skill Hub (`skills` + `platform-api` + `platform-web`) (Week 10–11)
**Goal**: The skills registry is live and agents can be equipped with skills from the UI.

### Deliverables
- [ ] `skills` repo: structure, `registry.json`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] First 5 skills: `github`, `web_search`, `summarize`, `slack`, `healthcheck`

- [ ] Agent Builder UI: multi-step wizard (Identity → Mission → Skills → Review)
- [ ] Skill detail page (description, tools, which agents use it)
- [ ] Community skill install from Git URL

### Success Criteria
User browses the Skill Hub, adds the `github` skill to an agent, and runs it — without touching any files.

---

## What to Build First

Start with **Phase 0** — `agent-core` as a standalone binary. This is the right first step because:
- It produces something immediately useful (run agents from your terminal today)
- It validates the core loop, provider integrations, and tool system before building the platform around it
- When `platform-api` is ready, it just imports `pkg/agent` — no rewrite needed
- Skills developed for the standalone binary work identically in the platform

Everything else builds on top of a proven core.
